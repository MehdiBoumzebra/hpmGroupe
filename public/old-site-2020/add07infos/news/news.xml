<title>Automatic thumbnails</title> 
<description>One of the smartest features of this file is its ablity to generate thumbnails. All you have to do is supply the large image and a thumbnail is produced at runtime, according to the size you set in the configuation section. No more hours spent resizing images in photoshop !
All images have super slick preloaders and fade in on load.

<title>Intelligent scrollbar</title> 
<description>Another nice feature is the intelligent scrollbar system. Hidden unless needed the slick scroll bar automatically resizes depending on the size of your news blog. There are settings to easily change the speed, easing and color of the scrollbar. Here is some dummy text to show how it works:
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</description>

<title>Automatic summaries</title> 
<description>The summaries are automatically generated. You simply set the amount of characters you wish to display. The code is smart enough to ensure you will always end on a full word.
